- [x] Background colours: 
  - [x] for Header and Survival: `background-color: #02160b`
  - [x] for Latest articles and Get notified: `background-color: #cccccc`

- [x] Latest articles
  - [x] Only flexbox, grid or float can be used. `<table>` is forbidden
  - [x] Texts could be placed over images using `position: absolute`, images can be added using `background-image`, though it is not semantically correct
  - [x] A slider navigation is interactive

  - [x] Use `<form>`
  - [x] An e-mail input should be marked up with `<input>` and `type` is `text` or `email`

## Recommendations

- For a pixel perfect check use a Chrome extension "PerfectPixel by WellDoneCode"
- A button "Sign in" could be `a` or `button`
- The final layout should be visually similar to the mockup in Figma
